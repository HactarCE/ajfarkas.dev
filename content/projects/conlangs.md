> A constructed language (shortened to conlang) is a language whose phonology, grammar, orthography, and vocabulary, instead of having developed naturally, are consciously devised for some purpose, which may include being devised for a work of fiction.

## Toki Pona

I am proficient with [Toki Pona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toki_Pona) and use it intermittently for casual conversation with my housemates. My name in Toki Pona is _jan Antu_ (Andrew) or _jan Akata_ (Hactar).

For learning Toki Pona, I recommend using either [linku.la](https://linku.la/) or [nimi.li](https://nimi.li/) to look up words and watching [jan Misali's toki pona lessons](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuYLhuXt4HrQwIDV7FBkA8zApw0pnEJrX) (as many as have been released). As of November 2024, I think the biggest thing missing from the video series is time idioms (such as _tempo suno_ for "day"). If you know a good learning resource, please reach out to me at [toki@ajfarkas.dev](toki@ajfarkas.dev)!

## New Ithkuil

I was very active in the online [Ithkuil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithkuil) community from 2017 to 2019, and contributed to New Ithkuil. The official documentation for New Ithkuil is on [ithkuil.net](https://ithkuil.net/), but it is poorly formatted and contains many errors so I recommend learning from the [Community Revised Edition](https://yuorb.github.io/en/docs/).

I may return to conlanging someday. I'm inspired by New Ithkuil's grammatical precision but I think there is still room for improvement, and its lexical priorities are very bizarre. (Is it really necessary to have a separate root for every single genus of flora and fauna? And a stem for "garage door opener," but not "garage," "door," or "remote control"?)
