## 4D

At the time of writing (April 2025), I hold the speedsolving world records for 3x3x3x3, 4x4x4x4, and 5x5x5x5 puzzles, and was the first person to solve a 3x3x3x3 in less than 2 minutes. See the [hypercubing.xyz leaderboards](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/) for the current world records, [my hypercubing.xyz profile](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/hactar/) for my official PBs, and [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBQ7ltR88PRukkrTqT8Wld5g2zBWjdIgg) for some videos of my solves.

## 3D

As of 2025, I average 13 seconds on 3x3x3 using a stickerless QY M Pro. Based on 40,000 timed solves from 2018 to 2025, I have a mean of **13.09** seconds with a standard deviation of **1.89**. My personal best is **6.46** seconds. See [my WCA profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014FARK01) for my official PBs.
