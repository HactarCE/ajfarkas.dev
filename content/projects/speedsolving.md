## 4D

At the time of writing (November 2024), I hold the speedsolving world records for 3x3x3x3, 4x4x4x4, and 5x5x5x5 puzzles, and am the only person who has solved a 3x3x3x3 in less than 2 minutes. See the [hypercubing.xyz leaderboards](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/) for the current world records and see [my hypercubing.xyz profile](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/hactar/) for my official PBs and [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBQ7ltR88PRukkrTqT8Wld5g2zBWjdIgg) for some videos of my solves.

## 3D

As of 2023, I average 12 to 13 seconds on 3x3x3 using a stickerless MoYu WeiLong GTS3M. My personal best is 6.46 seconds. See [my WCA profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014FARK01) for my official PBs.
