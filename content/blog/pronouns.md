They/he for Hactar, he/they for Andrew
{{< /lead >}}

<!--more-->

When I use the name **Andrew** in-person, I prefer <span class="blue">he/him</span> pronouns for myself. <span class = "green">They/them</span> feels a little weird, but I'm ok with it. If people used it more, I'd probably become more comfortable with it.

When I use the name **Hactar** online, I prefer <span class="green">they/them</span> pronouns. <span class="blue">He/him</span> isn't _wrong_, but it is _presumptious_. Many of the communities I take part in are dominated by <span class="blue">he/him</span>s, but not everyone there is a <span class="blue">he/him</span>, and the assumption of <span class="blue">he/him</span>ness perpetuates stereotypes that make it harder for non-<span class="blue">he/him</span>s to exist comfortably in these spaces. I want <span class="green">they/them</span> to be the default in these online communities, so I encourage others to use <span class="green">they/them</span> to refer to me unless they have seen some aspect of my in-person presentation that leads them to think of me as a <span class="blue">he/him</span>.
